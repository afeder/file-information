# Repository Contribution Guidelines

### Environment
- Environments for AI agents should be configured to log environment setup results to the file `/tmp/agent_environment_log`.
- Setup scripts should log the magic phrase "ENVIRONMENT SETUP COMPLETE." as the final
line in the file `/tmp/agent_environment_log`. If this phrase is missing from the file,
it implies that setup of the environment failed prematurely.
- If agents encounter unexpectedly missing packages, they should consult this file to determine if the environment was set up successfully. If it wasn't, they should communicate
it to the user.
- OpenAI Codex does not appear to run user setup scripts for "Ask" tasks. While this is
  not officially documented, it has been reported by other users.

### Code
- The constant `XSD_DATETYPE` in `src/main.rs` correctly references the URI `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateType` used by Tracker. Renaming the constant or altering this URI would be incorrect.

### Other
- When altering `src/main.rs`, add as many detailed, instructive, and explanatory comments as possible. It's better to include more comments, with plenty of detail, rather than too fewâ€”any unnecessary comments can be easily reviewed and removed later.
- Before committing, run `tests/run_tests.sh` to ensure tests pass.
  - If tests fail, note it in the pull request.
- Running `tests/run_tests.sh` may take a considerable amount of time because it
has to compile large libraries like GTK.
- Keep commit messages concise and in imperative mood (e.g. "add feature" rather than "added feature").
