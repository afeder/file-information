# Repository Contribution Guidelines

- Before committing, run `cargo test` to ensure tests pass.
  - If tests fail due to missing dependencies, note it in the pull request.
- Keep commit messages concise and in imperative mood (e.g. "add feature" rather than "added feature").
- Base the pull request title and description on the changes in the pull request as a whole.
